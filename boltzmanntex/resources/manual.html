<h1>BoltzmannTex User Manual</h1>

<p>
<b>BoltzmannTex is alpha quality software. While steps have been taken in the
subprograms to create accurate results, this software, in its current state
should not be depended on for actual real world use.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Please use this software at your own risk and not as your primary method of
computation.</b>
</p>

<a name="introduction"> <h2>Introduction</h2> </a>

<p>
BoltzmannTex is a program for performing predefined transformations and
visualisations on acquired data using simple Graphical User Intefaces. This
software is mainly meant for well defined techniques that can be rigidly written
as a program, and do not require regular testing, editing or substantial
knowledge of programming for usage) for usage (such as in the case of python
scripts).
</p>

<p>
BoltzmannTex aims to be modular enough to be easily extendable for more
sub-programs.
</p>

<a name="gettingstarted"> <h2>Getting Started</h2> </a>

<p>
BoltzmannTex, when first launched, displays a welcome screen with a list of
options. these options are called <b>Subprograms</b> and allow you to perform
a certain computation.
</p>

<a name="graphs"> <h2>Using Interactive Graphs Within the Program</h2> </a>

<p>
The interactive graphs presented to the user by the program can be zoomed into,
panned and scaled based on individual axes using the mouse. The steps to
perform each of these operations are as follows:

<ul>
<li> <b>To pan or move the graph:</b> Click and drag the left mouse button.</li>
<li> <b>To zoom in and out of the graph:</b> Scroll up on down of the graph
     while the mouse is above the graph.</li>
<li> <b>To scale an individual axis:</b> Put the mouse around the label of one
     of the axes, and scroll up and down.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="subprograms"> <h2>Available Subprograms</h2> </a>

<p>
BoltzmannTex currently has 2 functional Subprograms available:

<ol>
<li> Optical Emmision Spectroscopy Temperature Calculation</li>
<li> Simple Graph Plotting </li>
</ol>
</p>

<a name="oes"> <h2>Optical Emmision Spectroscopy Temperature Calculation</h2> </a>

<p>
This subprogram allows the user to perform temperature calculation of thermal
plasma using optical emission spectroscopy based on the spectral signatures
of the material being examined.
</p>

<a name="oes:materialdata"> <h3>Material Data Input Screen</h3> </a>

<p>
This screen allows the user to input the material data of the spectrum that is
being analysed. Four Parameters are required for each emmision line in the
spectrum: The Wavelength, the Transition probability, the Upper Level Energy and
the Degeneracy, and are input into the table area available on the screen. The
number of rows in the table is the number of emmision lines that will be
considered by the program. When this list is populated by the user, the
program is allowed to move to the next step.
</p>

<a name="oes:materialdataimport"> <h3>Providing Material Data Input as File</h3> </a>

<p>
Material data input can also be provided by importing a delimiter-separated table
of values into the program by clicking the "Import" button visible. To prepare
this table, one can simply use a text editor to enter each value, separate them
by space for each column, and by a new line ("enter" key) for each row.
</p>

<p>
A second method would be to use a word processor or a spreadsheet program
such as Microsoft Office or Libreoffice. One can prepare a graphical table of
each value, then copy the entire table, and then paste it into a text editor.
The file then can be opened by the program.
</p>

<a name="oes:spectraldata"> <h3>Spectral Data Input Screen</h3> </a>

<p>
This screen allows the user to input the data of the spectral readings of the
observation, as well as input the defined emission line ranges (or peaks) within
the readings. When the correct number of peak ranges are supplied to the
program, the program is allowed to proceed to the next step.
</p>

<a name="oes:peakareacomputation"> <h3>Peak Area Computation Screen</h3> </a>

<p>
This screen shows all the areas of the individual peaks defined.
</p>

<a name="oes:regressionanalysis"> <h3>Regression Analysis Screen</h3> </a>

<p>
This screen shows each of the observation points taken into consideration in the
regression analysis phase or the linear fitting phase of the calculation.
The user is shown a graph with all the points as well as the fitted line. On the
right the numerical values of each point are shown in the order of the peaks.
The user is also given an option to discard any of the peaks from the
final calculation of the temperature by clicking a checkbox next to each entry.
</p>

<p>
The result is immediately updated on clicking one of the entries.
</p>

<a name="oes:resultanderror"> <h3>Result Screen</h3> </a>

<p>
This screen shows the final resultant temperature, the correlation coefficient
of the linear regression data, and the coefficient of determination
(R<sup>2</sup>) value of the fitting.
</p>

<p>
A button for generating a report from the available data and another button is
available here for saving the images of the plots from the program.
